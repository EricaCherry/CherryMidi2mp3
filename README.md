# CherryMidi2mp3
Simple Midi to mp3 converter with soundfont selection. 
Render any .midi file with the soundfont of your choice! 


The script will create a .ini file which holds the default directories for soundfonts and .midi files for further customization! 


FEATURES (SO FAR) 
1. IT WORKS!! 
2. you can pick your own soundfont. 
3. thats pretty much it. 
4. most non default soundfonts sound better with a velocity modifier so this script will also boost the velocity of all the notes for better output.

enjoy!
